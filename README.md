### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Kate Halushka (she/her)


I am a third year CS student at GWU in Washington, DC! I am passionate about teaching the next generation of computer scientists. I am currently an Undergraduate TA for GW's CSCI 2461 course (Computer Architecture), and last year I was an LA (Learning Asst.) for CSCI 1111 (Intro to Java). Last summer, I interned at Liberty Mutual, and I am looking forward to interning at Nike this summer following my semester abroad at King's College London.
