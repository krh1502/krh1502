### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Kate Halushka (she/her)


I am a recent graduate of GWU in Washington, DC! I recently joined [Capital One](https://www.capitalonecareers.com/full-time-programs) in the Technology Development Program (TDP) as a software engineer in McLean, VA.

I am passionate about teaching the next generation of computer scientists. During college, I was a UTA/LA for Databases and Team Projects, Operating Systems, Computer Architcture, and Intro to Software Engineering (Java). 

In 2023, I interned at [Nike](https://innovation.nike.com/), working on the Sports Science Platform (SSP) within the Product Innovation & Consumer Creation (PICC) organization. I also interned at [Liberty Mutual](https://jobs.libertymutualgroup.com/careers/campus/undergraduate-internships/technology/) in 2022 and [Mindgrub](https://mindgrub.com/) from 2019-2020.

Feel free to check out my projects on Github!
